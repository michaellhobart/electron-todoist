# Electron Todoist
A desktop app to expedite adding to-do's from work requests to Todoist in a particular format that I use regularly.
1. Projects are pulled into the app from Todoist. User can choose which project to use.
2. User adds the name of the person making the request, and a description of the request.
3. On submit, the task is added to the project selected.

## Setup
Add Todoist API key to functions.js
